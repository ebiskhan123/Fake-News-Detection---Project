0,Russia expels more British diplomats over spy poisoning row,"Moscow orders diplomatic staff to be reduced to same level as Russian missions in Britain

Russia has announced a further round of expulsions of British diplomats, escalating the fallout over the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter.

Britain has pointed the finger firmly at the Kremlin for the Salisbury attack and expelled 23 Russian diplomats, a move swiftly followed in kind by Russia, which also closed down the British Council, the cultural arm of the British government.

The Russians have now ordered Britain to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia to the same level as Russian diplomatic missions in the UK. It comes after irritation in Moscow that Britain has persuaded so many other countries to expel Russians.

Russian officials have been taken aback by the level of coordination in the expulsions, and the number of countries willing to go along with Britain. The US expelled 60 Russian diplomats and Ukraine 13, while many other countries expelled smaller numbers.



In total, more than 150 Russian diplomats, many of whom are believed to be intelligence operatives working under diplomatic cover, have been expelled from two dozen countries.



On Thursday, Russia made symmetrical responses to all the countries that expelled its diplomats, and now Britain has been given 30 days to reduce the number of stationed in Russia.



Russia’s foreign ministry summoned the British ambassador, Laurie Bristow, on Friday morning in light of the “provocative and unsubstantiated actions by Britain, which instigated the expulsion of Russian diplomats from various nations for no reason”.



“It’s regrettable but in light of Russia’s previous behaviour, we anticipated a response,” said a spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office (FCO). “However, this doesn’t change the facts of the matter. The attempted assassination of two people on British soil, for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable.”



It was not immediately clear how many people work at Russia’s UK missions and therefore how many British diplomats in Russia will need to be shed.

The Russian embassy in London said via a Twitter direct message that “the British side is aware of the figures in question” but declined to give a number, while a spokesperson for the embassy in Moscow said it was too early to say, and that the FCO did not give figures for employees at its missions due to security reasons.



Russia has vehemently denied being behind the attack on Skripal, who was sent to Britain during a 2010 spy swap. Scientists have determined the Skripals were poisoned using novichok, a nerve agent produced in the Soviet Union.

The preferred narrative in Russia is that Britain orchestrated the attack as a “false flag” operation to cast blame on Russia. Andrei Bezrukov, formerly a deep cover Russian spy in the US, said on state television this week that the poisoning was a diversionary tactic organised by the Tory government to save Theresa May.



The foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has suggested the same, posting on Facebook a clip from the 1980s comedy Yes Prime Minister, in which the characters consider expelling Russian diplomats to distract attention from a scandal at home.

Zakharova has said the response to the Salisbury incident has been “a huge manipulation of public opinion with the participation of the British authorities”, while Russian officials have accused the UK of hiding evidence.

On Thursday, reports emerged that Yulia Skripal, 33, is conscious and talking, having apparently made a surprising recovery from what was considered a grave condition. Her father’s condition is described as critical but stable.



Investigators continue a massive operation to determine how the poisoning took place, with the latest reports suggesting the poison was most likely placed on the front door handle at Skripal’s house.",1,Russia expels more British diplomats over spy poisoning row
1,Western allies expel scores of Russian diplomats over Skripal attack,"More than 20 western allies have ordered the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats in response to the nerve agent attack in the UK, in a show of solidarity that represents the biggest concerted blow to Russian intelligence networks in the west since the cold war.

Over 100 Russian diplomats alleged to be spies in western countries are being told to return to Moscow, in a coordinated response to the use of a chemical weapon in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence official, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March.

In a sombre statement in the House of Commons, Theresa May welcomed what she said was “the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history”.

“I have found great solidarity from our friends and partners in the EU, North America, Nato and beyond over the past three weeks as we have confronted the aftermath of the Salisbury incident,” the prime minister said. “And together we have sent a message that we will not tolerate Russia’s continued attempts to flout international law and undermine our values.” She added: “If the Kremlin’s goal is to divide and intimidate the western alliance, then their efforts have spectacularly backfired.”

The Russian government called the expulsions “a provocative gesture” and said it would retaliate in kind, raising the prospect of further tit-for-tat expulsions, as the US and Europe left the door open for additional measures. The Kremlin said Vladimir Putin would make the final decision, and the Russian embassy in the US launched a poll on Twitter asking which US consulate in Russia should be closed.

The US has ordered the expulsion of 60 Russian officials who Washington says are spies, including a dozen based at the United Nations, and told Moscow to shut down its consulate in Seattle, which would end Russian diplomatic representation on the west coast.

The EU members Germany, France and Poland are each to expel four Russian diplomats with intelligence agency backgrounds. Lithuania and the Czech Republic said they would expel three, and Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands two each. Estonia, Latvia, Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Sweden and Romania each expelled one Russian. Iceland announced it would not be sending officials to the World Cup in Russia.

Ukraine, which is not an EU member, is to expel 13 Russian diplomats, while Albania, an EU candidate member, ordered the departure of two Russians from the embassy in Tirana. Macedonia, another EU candidate, expelled one Russian official.

Canada announced it was expelling four diplomatic staff serving in Ottawa and Montreal who the Canadian government said were spies. A pending application from Moscow for three more diplomatic posts in Canada is being denied.

Australia confirmed that it too would expel two Russian diplomats who were in the country as undeclared intelligence officers, giving them seven days to leave.

Raj Shah, a White House spokesperson, told reporters Monday that the US expulsions were part of “a coordinated effort”.

He added that Donald Trump “spoke with many foreign leaders, European allies and others and encouraged them to join with the United States in this announcement”.

Shah described the expulsions as “an important message to send to Russia and significant to degrading their intelligence capabilities”.

By the close of the day a small “coalition of the unwilling” inside the EU had indicated to the UK Foreign Office that they were not prepared to expel any Russian diplomats in solidarity with the UK. The eight countries were Portugal, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Slovenia and Luxembourg. Belgium and Ireland made no announcements but have indicated action will be taken after cabinet meetings.

The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats in the wake of the poisoning, and Russia responded by ejecting the same number of British diplomats.



The Russian foreign ministry issued a statement denouncing the expulsions as “an unfriendly step” based on alliances rather than evidence.



“The provocative gesture of the so-called solidarity of these countries with London, which blindly followed the British authorities in the so-called Skripal case and which never got around to sort out the circumstances of the incident, is a continuation of the confrontational policy to escalate the situation,” the statement said.

The UK has refused to provide a sample of the nerve agent to Russia but has supplied one to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is conducting its own investigation.

A senior US official said the expulsions and the Seattle consulate closure were in response to “a reckless attempt by the [Russian] government to murder a British citizen and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent”.

A second official said the measures were also intended as a response to a “steady drumbeat of destabilising and aggressive actions” by Moscow against the US and its allies.

Timeline Poisoned umbrellas and polonium: Russian-linked UK deaths Show Hide Georgi Markov In one of the most chilling episodes of the cold war, the Bulgarian dissident was poisoned with a specially adapted umbrella on Waterloo Bridge. As he waited for a bus, Markov felt a sharp prick in his leg. The opposition activist, who was an irritant to the communist government of Bulgaria, died three days later. A deadly pellet containing ricin was found in his skin. His unknown assassin is thought to have been from the secret services in Bulgaria. Alexander Litvinenko The fatal poisoning of the former FSB officer sparked an international incident. Litvinenko fell ill after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium. He met his killers in a bar of the Millennium hotel in Mayfair. The pair were Andrei Lugovoi – a former KGB officer turned businessman, who is now a deputy in Russia’s state Duma – and Dmitry Kovtun, a childhood friend of Lugovoi’s from a Soviet military family. Putin denied all involvement and refused to extradite either of the killers. German Gorbuntsov The exiled Russian banker survived an attempt on his life as he got out of a cab in east London. He was shot four times with a silenced pistol. He had been involved in a bitter dispute with two former business partners. Alexander Perepilichnyy The businessman collapsed while running near his home in Surrey. Traces of a chemical that can be found in the poisonous plant gelsemium were later found in his stomach. Before his death, Perepilichnyy was helping a specialist investment firm uncover a $230m Russian money-laundering operation, a pre-inquest hearing was told. Hermitage Capital Management claimed that Perepilichnyy could have been deliberately killed for helping it uncover the scam involving Russian officials. He may have eaten a popular Russian dish containing the herb sorrel on the day of his death, which could have been poisoned. Boris Berezovsky The exiled billionaire was found hanged in an apparent suicide after he had spent more than decade waging a high-profile media battle against his one-time protege Putin. A coroner recorded an open verdict after hearing conflicting expert evidence about the way he died. A pathologist who conducted a postmortem examination on the businessman’s body said he could not rule out murder. Scot Young An associate of Berezovsky whom he helped to launder money, he was found impaled on railings after he fell from a fourth-floor flat in central London. A coroner ruled that there was insufficient evidence of suicide. But Young, who was sent to prison in January 2013 for repeatedly refusing to reveal his finances during a divorce row, told his partner he was going to jump out of the window moments before he was found.



The alleged spies being expelled from the US include 48 in the Russian embassy in Washington and 12 at the Russian mission at the UN, who the US says are engaged in “aggressive collection here in the US”.

US officials said the spies at the UN were abusing their residence privileges under the UN headquarters agreement. They said there were more than 100 Russian spies in the US and the expulsions would significantly reduce Russian espionage capabilities in the country. The expelled Russians have seven days to leave the country.

Mark Simakovsky, a former Russia desk director at the Pentagon, said the mass expulsions by such a large number of countries acting in concert were unprecedented, but Moscow still had plenty of ways to spy on the west.

“Most Russian intelligence operations are not being done by agents acting under cover of diplomatic protocols,” said Simakovsky, now a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council. “Most likely, the poisoning of the Skripals was not done by anyone in an embassy or consulate.”

Daniel Fried, a former state department sanctions coordinator, said the only measures likely to have real effect on Putin’s behaviour would be sanctions aimed at Russian money in the west.

“This is impressive but it is still the standard playbook,” Fried said. “If we are serious about this, we ought to think outside the box. I would start going after the money, and make clear that Russia is not going to find the west a convenient place to do business. That means going after London real estate, and you can’t do that without getting Miami and New York involved.”

The White House issued a statement saying the US was acting to “make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences”. Trump did not comment on Twitter, his usual form of expression on issues he feels strongly about.

Expulsions of Russians are pushback against Putin's hybrid warfare | Patrick Wintour Read more

While other members of his administration have spoken out strongly against Russia, in particular for its interference in the 2016 US election, Trump has avoided saying or tweeting anything critical of the Kremlin, and last week defied his advisers in congratulating Putin on winning an election generally seen as closed and unfair.

A senior US official said on Monday that the nature of the Russian response to UK allegations had helped convince the administration that the Kremlin was culpable.

“Russia has had nearly a month to respond but instead of explaining has engaged in the usual obfuscation we have seen in the past,” a US official said, noting that Moscow had put out a series of conflicting stories and attempted to put the blame on others, including the US. EU heads of state concluded last week that it was highly likely the Russian state was responsible for the attack. The EU is also looking at coordinated steps to rein back Russian hybrid warfare.",1,Russia expels more British diplomats over spy poisoning row
2,Russia expels diplomats in tit-for-tat action over Salisbury attack,"US consulate in St Petersburg to be closed and 60 American diplomats expelled in first wave of action, foreign minister says

Russia will close down the US consulate in St Petersburg and expel 60 American diplomats as it takes tit-for-tat measures against all the nations that have expelled Russian diplomats over the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said.

More than 25 countries have announced plans to expel a total of more than 130 Russian diplomats in solidarity with the UK over what has been described as the first chemical weapons attack on European soil since the second world war.



Lavrov said US ambassador Jon Huntsman has been summoned to the foreign ministry, where he was given notice that Russia is responding quid pro quo to the US decision to order 60 Russian diplomats out. The expelled officials include 58 from the US embassy in Moscow and two from its consulate in Ekaterinburg.

Lavrov said Moscow will also respond to the US decision to shut the Russian consulate in Seattle by closing the US consulate in St Petersburg.

The same approach will be applied to other nations that expelled Russian diplomats this week, he added.



Russia was reacting to “absolutely unacceptable actions that are taken against us under very harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case”, Lavrov said. He accused London of “forcing everyone to follow an anti-Russian course”.

At the briefing in Moscow, Lavrov accused Britain of “making mockery of international law”. Russia had asked for a meeting with the executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on Tuesday to ask questions to “establish the truth”, he said.

Yulia Skripal no longer in critical condition, say Salisbury doctors Read more

Earlier on Thursday the Russian foreign ministry accused Britain of refusing to provide information on Yulia Skripal, who was poisoned along with her father, Sergei, a former spy, in Salisbury this month.

“British authorities finally spoke today about Yulia Skripal’s condition. As people say, she’s on the mend quickly. And we have demanded again that we are given access to Yulia, as a Russian citizen,” Lavrov said, Interfax reported.



Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said Britain had declined to cooperate with Russia on the investigation into the poisoning and had not provided any updates on Yulia Skripal despite the fact she was a Russian citizen.

Britain accuses Russia of responsibility for the poisoning, something Moscow vehemently denies.

Zakharova said Britain’s behaviour ran counter to a 1968 consular agreement signed between the then Soviet Union and Britain under which Moscow was meant to have access to its nationals on British soil and to be able to give them advice.



Zakharova said nobody had cancelled the agreement, which she said still had force in international law. The UK is likely to argue that an agreement between the UK and the Soviet Union is not enforceable in court and there is no reason to give Russia access to a woman it apparently tried to kill.

Yulia Skripal is said to be “improving rapidly” in hospital and is no longer in a critical condition. Her father remains in a critical but stable condition, Salisbury NHS trust said on Thursday.

Russia challenged claims made by Dean Haydon, Britain’s counter-terror police chief, that the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent from their front door.

“Traces of the nerve agent have been found at some of the other scenes detectives have been working at over the past few weeks, but at lower concentrations to that found at the home address,” Haydon said on Wednesday.

Maj-Gen Alexander Mikhailov, from the Russian security agency FSB, claimed that if it was true the poisoning had happened on the doorstep then the Skripals would have died instantly and would not made it as far as the park where they were found slumped on a bench.

Mikhailov said Theresa May should resign for misleading world opinion.

Both sides are waiting for a report from the OPCW, which sent experts to visit the scene in Salisbury and is studying samples of the nerve agent.

Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary of Russian president Vladimir Putin, said it was difficult to guess what other options for anti-Russian measures Britain could take.

“As for the UK, due to the fact that now it is a fairly unpredictable country in relations with the Russian Federation, it is difficult for us to judge what other options can be considered, and what can be the basis for this,” Peskov said.

In Germany, the government’s decision to expel Russian diplomats this week in solidarity with the UK has widened splits, with senior politicians demanding the UK comes forward with concrete proof of Russian involvement in the poisoning.

The deputy leader of the Social Democrats, Ralf Stegner, criticised the expulsion in an interview for the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, saying he feared an escalation in measures “which can still hurt us very much”. He said: “Appearances and plausibility are not enough to convict.”",1,Russia expels more British diplomats over spy poisoning row

The location where the nerve agent novichok was developed and produced is a closed town in central Russia, Shikhany, according to a chemical weapons expert, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon.

Shikhany is the Russian equivalent of Porton Down, home to various research facilities that deal with radiation and chemical weapons.

He said the information was disclosed in a report sent by the Russians to the international body responsible for monitoring chemical weapons, the Organisation for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.",0,Russia expels more British diplomats over spy poisoning row
4,Nato expels seven staff from Russian mission over Skripal poisoning,"Nato has announced it is cutting the size of its Russian mission by a third, removing accreditation from seven Russian staff and rejecting three other pending applications.

The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the permanent size of the Russian mission would be cut from 30 to 20 people, adding the announcement was “a clear and very strong message that there was a cost to Russia’s reckless actions” in poisoning the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury earlier this month.

He claimed Russia had underestimated Nato’s resolve and said the announcements would reduce Russia’s capability to do intelligence work across Nato.

The move came after more than 20 western allies ordered the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats in response to the nerve agent attack in the UK in a show of solidarity that represents the biggest concerted blow to Russian intelligence networks in the west since the cold war.

Speaking in Brussels at the end of consultations with Nato allies on Tuesday, Stoltenberg added that he did not think Russia had expected the west to show such resolve, pointing to the increased Nato military presence on the Russia border, higher defence spending and continued sanctions for Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea.

He said the Nato response was aimed not just at the poisoning in Salisbury, the first use of a nerve agent on Nato territory, but a response to a broader pattern of unacceptable and illegal behaviour.

The US state department said that Donald Trump had “personally ordered” the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats in Washington and New York who US intelligence believe to be spies, and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle. It was the biggest single expulsion order in US history.

The department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said that Washington had played a key role in organising the global response. US officials, she said “have worked tirelessly over the past three weeks to achieve this unprecedented level of cooperation and also coordination”.

Earlier on Tuesday the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed the US had used “colossal blackmail” to force European and other western powers to expel Russian diplomats, and promised Moscow would respond harshly to the expulsion of more than 100 Russian diplomats worldwide.

Speaking at a conference on Afghanistan in Tashkent, Lavrov said: “When one or two diplomats are asked to leave this or that country, with apologies being whispered into our ears, we know for certain that this is a result of colossal pressure and colossal blackmail, which is Washington’s chief instrument in the international scene.”

Briefing the cabinet on Tuesday, the prime minister, Theresa May, reported that 23 countries had expelled more than 115 Russian intelligence diplomats. She told her cabinet colleagues this represented an unprecedented series of expulsions that has demonstrated to the Kremlin “that we will not tolerate their attempts to flout international law, undermine our values or threaten our security”.

Play Video 1:07 Theresa May: ‘largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history’ – video

She added allies were not only taking these actions out of solidarity with the UK but also because they recognised the threat that these Russian networks pose to the security of their own countries and the pattern of aggression that had affected every country.



Only a handful of EU countries including Austria, Portugal, Greece and Malta, have declined to take any steps. Many countries have confined themselves to a tokenistic expulsion of a single diplomat, a move designed to register support for the UK, as opposed to causing disruption to the Russian state.



Britain is now waiting to see if other states follow May’s example and announce they will not be sending official delegations, as opposed to sporting teams, to the World Cup in Russia this summer. British officials acknowledge that public opinion in many countries, notably Germany, is not hostile to Russia, and there is a strict political limit to the sanctions the EU collectively is willing to take.",1,Russia expels more British diplomats over spy poisoning row

Moscow is to expel 23 UK diplomats and shut down the British Council in Russia amid increasing tensions over a nerve agent attack against a former double agent and his daughter on British soil.

Russian elite must reveal how they paid for UK property, say MPs Read more

The Russian foreign ministry summoned the British ambassador on Saturday to inform him of the retaliatory action taken after the UK’s expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats.

But the Russian Federation has gone a step further and shut down all activities of the British Council, which promotes greater understanding of the UK and the English language. The foreign ministry said it would also close a consulate in St Petersburg.

Speaking at the Conservative party spring forum on Saturday, Theresa May said: “We anticipated a response of this kind and we will consider our next steps in the coming days alongside our allies and partners.”

She said the UK would “never tolerate a threat to the life of British citizens and others on British soil from the Russian government”.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said the government had anticipated such a response and that the National Security Council would meet early next week to consider Britain’s next steps.



The UK has already said – perhaps as a deterrent to the Russians – that if Moscow escalated the row with its reprisals, the UK had ready a second phase of possible measures in place. No 10 will now have to decide whether to risk a spiral of further punishments.



The most obvious step is to expel the Russian ambassador to Britain who is probably coming to the end of his term, but any such expulsion could lead to Moscow proposing an alternative. Withdrawing the England football team from the World Cup remains off-limits.

A former national security adviser said the priority should be to gather international support for a new approach towards Russia, a process that starts on Monday at a long-scheduled meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.

Lord Ricketts said: “The biggest losers from this closure of the excellent British Council programme are the Russian people. Britain’s most effective steps now are to go after the regime-linked hot money in London and to campaign for the Salisbury attack to be seen as a threat to the international community.”

The British Council said: “We are profoundly disappointed at this development. It is our view that when political or diplomatic relations become difficult, cultural relations and educational opportunities are vital to maintain ongoing dialogue between people and institutions.

“We remain committed to the development of long-term people-to-people links with Russia as we do in over 100 other countries.”

The former British ambassador to Moscow Sir Roderic Lyne counselled against further tit-for-tat diplomatic measures, saying: “It is not sensible to mud-wrestle with a gorilla.”



Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee, also cautioned against further pure diplomatic measures. He said Vladimir Putin’s greatest vulnerability lay in the exposure of his personal wealth, and suggested making life uncomfortable for the Russian president’s close allies with property in London.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Tugendhat said: “We should be absolutely clear – none of the 23 British diplomats being expelled have been involved in the attempted murder of people in Russia. None of them have attempted to use nerve agents in the Russian Federation. None of them have put at risk hundreds and hundreds of Russian citizens to the most horrific death imaginable.

“So this is really absolutely symbolic and typical of a Russian Federation that has used lying and propaganda as a means of warfare and is now repeating its style.”

His committee will have an opportunity to press the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to explain what the government is doing to clamp down on the Russian oligarchs in London when Johnson gives evidence to the foreign affairs select committee on Wednesday. A group of Tory MPs are backing Labour’s calls for tougher legal measures.

British diplomats claim a panoply of measures are already in place, but the separation of powers in the UK means it is for the courts to deploy the law, not the government. But they also acknowledge that the scrupulous way the UK courts operate, and standards of evidence required, makes London a magnet for Russians to invest.

The Guardian understands that another measure under consideration is to persuade as many allies as possible not to congratulate Putin on his certain re-election victory on Sunday, as is customary. Officials understand that the measure is purely a token gesture, but will nonetheless send a message of collective disgust at the brazen use of a chemical weapon.



Officials are also believed to be sounding out European partners on whether they would be ready to expel Russian diplomatic staff from their territories too, though it is unclear how successful such overtures have been.

Speaking to reporters outside the Russian foreign ministry, Britain’s ambassador to Moscow, Laurie Bristow, said: “We will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves, our allies and our values against an attack of this sort, which is an attack not only on the United Kingdom, but upon the international rules-based system on which all countries, including Russia, depend for their safety and security.”

6,Russia threatens retaliation after Britain expels 23 diplomats,"May says Kremlin responded with ‘sarcasm, contempt and defiance’ to 24-hour deadline set by UK

Britain is braced for retaliation from Moscow after Theresa May blamed the Russian state for the Salisbury poisoning, and announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats and a crackdown on “corrupt elites”.

The prime minister told the House of Commons the Kremlin had responded with “sarcasm, contempt and defiance” to the 24-hour deadline the government set on Monday for explaining the attack on former spy Sergei Skripal.

“Their response has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events,” May told MPs. She said: “There is no alternative conclusion other than the Russian state was responsible for the attempted murder of Mr Skripal and his daughter.”

It was “unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom”, May said.

Skripal remains in a critical condition after the incident in Salisbury last week. Analysis carried out by government experts has found that the former spy and his daughter Yulia were exposed to a banned nerve agent, likely to have been manufactured in Russia.

May announced that the government would take a series of measures, including cutting off high-level diplomatic contact, strengthening powers to detain suspected intelligence agents at the border, and expelling 23 “undeclared intelligence agents”. That is the largest such move since the cold war, and marks a considerable escalation on the expulsion of four diplomats after the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in 2007.

“We will not tolerate the threat to life of British people and others on British soil from the Russian government. Nor will we tolerate such a flagrant breach of Russia’s international obligations,” May said. “We will freeze Russian state assets wherever we have evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents. There is no place for these people – or their money – in our country.”

May announced that a planned visit by the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, would be cancelled; and that no dignitaries or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup in Russia this summer – though she stopped short of backing a boycott of the tournament by the England team.

Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, had earlier confirmed that British diplomats would be expelled from Moscow in retaliation.

Asked in an interview with Sky News about what would happen after May’s statement, Yakovenko said: “There will be expulsions. As you understand in diplomatic practice, there will be answers from the Russian side.” When he was asked to clarify if this meant British diplomats being expelled from Moscow, he replied: “In diplomacy, there is always reciprocity.”

Yakovenko also said that what the UK government was doing was “absolutely unacceptable,” and that it should refer the matter to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

The Russian embassy in London appeared to brush off the seriousness of the situation, tweeting: “The temperature of Russia-UK relations drops to minus 23, but we are not afraid of cold weather.”

May’s Commons statement followed an announcement by the Foreign Office that the UK had called for an urgent meeting of the UN security council to update members on the investigation. EU leaders will also discuss the incident at a summit next week, said the European council president, Donald Tusk.

At the UN in New York on Wednesday night, the UK laid out the case against Russia, describing the nerve agent as “a weapon so horrific it is banned from use in war”.

Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said the US “stands in absolute solidarity” with Great Britain. “The United States believes that Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent. Dozens of civilians and first responders were also exposed,” Haley said.



“If we don’t take immediate concrete measures to address this now, Salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used. They could be used here in New York, or in cities of any country that sits on this council. This is a defining moment.”

Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian envoy to the UN, told the council: “No scientific research or development under the title novichok were carried out.”

Nebenzia alleged that the Salisbury poisoning was a false-flag attack, possibly by the UK itself, intended to tarnish Russia. “Most probable source of this agent are the countries who have carried out research on these weapons, including Britain,” he said.

The White House said it shared Britain’s assessment that Russia was responsible for the nerve agent and supported the decision to expel Russian diplomats.



It said the attack “fits into a pattern of behaviour in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes.”

French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressedconfidence in the investigations being carried out by Britain, though he was careful not to say directly that Russia was behind the attack. “In the coming hours, France will be in contact at the highest level with the British authorities to coordinate our response,” Le Drian said

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also stressed the need to involve the OPCW, which is based at the Hague, in investigating what he called “an appalling act of violence”. He said: “Nerve agents are abominable if used in any war. It is utterly reckless to use them in a civilian environment.”

Some other Labour MPs offered the prime minister more unequivocal backing – as did the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said: “There has to be a robust response to the use of terror on our streets. We must act in a measured way to show that we will simply not tolerate this behaviour.”

May repeatedly underlined the support of international allies, including Donald Trump, and German chancellor Angela Merkel.



But Corbyn’s cautious response found an echo in Paris, with President Emmanuel Macron’s spokesman Benjamin Griveaux saying it was too early for Paris to decide whether action should be taken.

“We don’t do fantasy politics. Once the elements are proven, then the time will come for decisions to be made,” Griveaux told reporters.

Griveaux said France was waiting for “definitive conclusions,” and evidence that the “facts were completely true,” before taking a position.

The Foreign Office updated its travel advice for British citizens planning to go to Russia in the coming months, warning of “the possibility of anti-British sentiment or harassment”.

“While the British Embassy in Moscow is not aware of any increased difficulties for British people travelling in Russia at this time, you should follow the security and political situation closely and keep up to date with this travel advice.”

A spokesman for the Football Association later said: “The FA will continue to work closely with the UK Government and relevant authorities regarding our participation in this summer’s Fifa World Cup and the Women’s World Cup qualifier in June.”

Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has called for a boycott of the tournament, which some fear will allow Russia to burnish its image on the international stage.

7,"Russia will hit back against countries expelling diplomats, says Johnson","Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, has predicted Russia will retaliate against countries that have acted in solidarity with the UK over the poisoning of Russian spy Sergei Skripal, suggesting Moscow may interfere with energy supplies, or disrupt the lives of their Moscow-based diplomats and their families.

Hailing the courage of the 27 countries that had backed Britain by taking action against Russia, he said their show of solidarity had crystallised a collective feeling across three continents that patience with Russia’s malign behaviour had come to an end.

Speaking to the Lord Mayor’s banquet at the Mansion House in London, Johnson pitched the dispute as a wider battle against Russian disruption, claiming “this week was the moment when the world decided to say enough to the wearying barrage of Russian lies, the torrent of obfuscation and intercontinental ballistic whoppers”.

He said: “It wasn’t about us. It was about all of us and the kind of world we want to live in. I believe these expulsions represent a moment when a feeling has suddenly crystallised, when years of vexation and provocation have worn the collective patience to breaking point, and when across the world – across three continents – there are countries who are willing to say enough is enough.”

Russia, he claimed, had underestimated the strength of global feeling against, and the accumulation of impatience with, Vladimir Putin’s behaviour.

In remarks that will raise the diplomatic temperature, Johnson also warned that countries that had sided with Britain “know full well that they face the risk of retaliation – and frankly there are countries that have taken action that are more vulnerable to Russia than we are, whether through geography or their energy needs”.

Timeline Poisoned umbrellas and polonium: Russian-linked UK deaths Show Hide Georgi Markov In one of the most chilling episodes of the cold war, the Bulgarian dissident was poisoned with a specially adapted umbrella on Waterloo Bridge. As he waited for a bus, Markov felt a sharp prick in his leg. The opposition activist, who was an irritant to the communist government of Bulgaria, died three days later. A deadly pellet containing ricin was found in his skin. His unknown assassin is thought to have been from the secret services in Bulgaria. Alexander Litvinenko The fatal poisoning of the former FSB officer sparked an international incident. Litvinenko fell ill after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium. He met his killers in a bar of the Millennium hotel in Mayfair. The pair were Andrei Lugovoi – a former KGB officer turned businessman, who is now a deputy in Russia’s state Duma – and Dmitry Kovtun, a childhood friend of Lugovoi’s from a Soviet military family. Putin denied all involvement and refused to extradite either of the killers. German Gorbuntsov The exiled Russian banker survived an attempt on his life as he got out of a cab in east London. He was shot four times with a silenced pistol. He had been involved in a bitter dispute with two former business partners. Alexander Perepilichnyy The businessman collapsed while running near his home in Surrey. Traces of a chemical that can be found in the poisonous plant gelsemium were later found in his stomach. Before his death, Perepilichnyy was helping a specialist investment firm uncover a $230m Russian money-laundering operation, a pre-inquest hearing was told. Hermitage Capital Management claimed that Perepilichnyy could have been deliberately killed for helping it uncover the scam involving Russian officials. He may have eaten a popular Russian dish containing the herb sorrel on the day of his death, which could have been poisoned. Boris Berezovsky The exiled billionaire was found hanged in an apparent suicide after he had spent more than decade waging a high-profile media battle against his one-time protege Putin. A coroner recorded an open verdict after hearing conflicting expert evidence about the way he died. A pathologist who conducted a postmortem examination on the businessman’s body said he could not rule out murder. Scot Young An associate of Berezovsky whom he helped to launder money, he was found impaled on railings after he fell from a fourth-floor flat in central London. A coroner ruled that there was insufficient evidence of suicide. But Young, who was sent to prison in January 2013 for repeatedly refusing to reveal his finances during a divorce row, told his partner he was going to jump out of the window moments before he was found.



He said: “I pay tribute to them because they know that their own Russia-based diplomats, and their families, must now deal with the possibility of their own lives being turned upside down.”

Johnson’s remarks are likely to be seen by Moscow as intended to deepen divisions between Europe and Russia. The Russian political leadership have insisted they will prepare reprisals against the nations that have expelled Russian ambassadors, but also do not want to exacerbate bilateral relations with some countries.

Moscow continues to insist that the Russian state was not involved in the poisoning, and now claims that the UK intelligence services may have been responsible as part of an effort to shore up support for Theresa May’s government due to the difficulties it faces in uniting the country over Brexit. It also says the solidarity shown by EU countries is largely due to bullying by America, and that many countries had privately indicated they had not wished to take any measures.

Russia is also calling for access to the nerve agent novichok that the UK intelligence services say was administered to Skripal and his daughter.

Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement: “Unless we receive convincing proof of the opposite, we will regard this incident as an attempt on the life of Russian citizens as part of a large-scale political provocation. We emphasise that the burden of proof rests solely on the UK.”

Johnson retorted that the Foreign Office has so far counted 24 ludicrous Russian lies about the cause of Skripal’s poisoning. He said: “It is rather like the beginning of Crime and Punishment in the sense that we are all confident of the culprit – and the only question is whether he will confess or be caught.”

Johnson put the poisoning in the context of the annexation of Crimea, the Russian intervention in Ukraine, the downing of flight MH17, cyber-attacks, the attempted coup in Montenegro, the concealing of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, the hacking of the Bundestag and interference in other countries’ elections.

He concluded: “There are now just too many countries who have felt the disruptive and malign behaviour of the Russian state.”

In a speech that was light on further measures against Russia, or a solution to the crisis, Johnson instead focused on how the episode showed the UK, once outside the EU, could remain a major player and work alongside the EU on security issues.



He argued the episode had been immensely reassuring since British people “had learned we may be leaving the EU in exactly a year but we will never be alone, and in part that commitment to Britain reflects Britain’s reciprocal commitment to our friends, whether through the work of our peerless intelligence agencies or our armed forces or our development budgets”.

He promised his EU colleagues: “We will stand by you as you have stood by us.”",1,Russia expels more British diplomats over spy poisoning row
8,At least 10 EU nations to expel Russian diplomats in spy row,"Russian intelligence agents and diplomats across the European Union will be expelled next week in response to the use of a nerve agent in Salisbury, described by Emmanuel Macron as an “attack on European sovereignty”.



At least 10 EU member states will order Russian officials to leave, with the number of countries answering the UK’s call for action expected to rise in the coming weeks.

“What happened in Great Britain has clearly never been seen before,” the French president told reporters, at the end of a summit where EU leaders agreed unanimously that Moscow was “highly likely” to be responsible for the assault. “It is an aggression against the security and the sovereignty of an ally, today a member of the European Union, which demands a reaction.”

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she agreed there should be further measures, beyond the recall earlier on Friday of the EU’s ambassador to Moscow.

France and Germany were among the first countries to back the UK and do not expect the investigation by experts at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to change their conclusions.

Macron said the OPCW work would be “useful, but is not going to change our vision of things”.

Donald Tusk, the European council president, said the Russians had stooped to a level to which the EU could never follow, but that it was up to leaders to do what they could to illustrate Europe’s condemnation.

The former Polish prime minister conceded there were different interests and attitudes to Russia among the member states, and not all would take measures against the Kremlin, but said the bloc’s response would still be without precedent.

Tusk said: “It is very difficult to prepare an adequate reaction to this kind of behaviour like a nerve agent attack. We will never have the real chance to respond adequately because we are completely different to the perpetrators of this attack, if you know what I mean.

“This is why I was focused yesterday on for me the most important political goal ... to keep the whole community united as possible in this very dramatic moment and situation and we reached this goal ... As a result of our decision yesterday I expect a number of member states will take additional measures against Russia on Monday. It is not the end of our actions.”

He added: “In these difficult circumstances I am personally especially pleased that despite the tough Brexit negotiations, the European Union has demonstrated unanimous and unequivocal unity with the UK in the face of this attack.”

Speaking as she departed from the meeting of leaders in Brussels, Theresa May confirmed that fresh evidence presented to the 27 other member states had encouraged them to endorse the UK’s analysis of the incident earlier this month, which left the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, fighting for their lives.

“We have been sharing throughout, sharing on intelligence channels what we can with our colleagues,” the prime minister said.

Italy is traditionally seen as having warmer relations with Moscow than most EU countries, but the country’s Europe minister, Sandro Gozi, said there was no hesitation from Italy “once things became clearer thanks to the information we got from [the British] prime minister”.

He said the recall of the EU’s ambassador “does not have immediate political or economic consequences”, but he hoped would “help the Russians to have a more constructive attitude”.

The situation highlighted the “Brexit paradox” of “the growing awareness in London of the need to develop a common approach that I hope will turn into a [post-Brexit] strong partnership on security, defence and foreign affairs”, Gozi added.

Member states understood to be preparing to oust diplomats include France, Germany, Poland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Denmark.

In response, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the UK of trying to make “the crisis with Russia as deep as possible”.



In London they “are feverishly trying to force allies to take confrontational steps”, he told reporters on a visit to Hanoi, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.",3,Russia expels more British diplomats over spy poisoning row
9,Australia expels two Russian diplomats over 'brazen' UK nerve agent attack,"Malcolm Turnbull says collective action is needed to tackle a ‘pattern of recklessness and aggression’ by Russia

Australia will expel two Russian diplomats as part of global action against Moscow over an alleged nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy living in the UK.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, made the announcement in Canberra on Tuesday, saying two Russian “diplomats” had been identified as undeclared intelligence officers and would be ordered to leave Australia within seven days.

On Tuesday night Russia’s ambassador to Australia indicated Russia was likely to retaliate in kind.

Turnbull said Russia’s alleged use of a chemical weapon to try to murder a former Russian intelligence official, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March reflected a pattern of “recklessness and aggression” by the Russian government that had to be stopped.

He said the “brazen” and “criminal” attack was an attack “on all of us”, and declared Russia was threatening no less than the “democratic world” by deliberately undermining the international rules-based order.

He said Australia could not stand by and watch the sovereignty of its allies breached. “This latest incident has demanded a response and has received a concerted international response from the United Kingdom’s allies and partners around the world,” he said. “To do nothing would only encourage further efforts to undermine the international rules-based order upon which our security and prosperity rely.

“It reflects a pattern of recklessness and aggression by the Russian government, including the annexation of Crimea, the invasion of eastern Ukraine, the downing of MH17, cyber attacks and efforts to manipulate western nations’ elections.

“There are credible reports that Russia was actively undermining the credibility of the Brexit referendum, last year’s presidential elections in France, and Catalonia’s referendum in Spain, and in the United States, one of the oldest and formidable democracies in the world, debate is raging about whether Russian intelligence operations may have tipped the presidential election.

“The foreign minister and I want to stress that Australia has no dispute with the Russian people. Indeed, today, we offer our condolences for the devastating fire that has killed scores of people in a shopping centre in a Siberian city. This is about the actions of the Russian government,” he said.

More than 20 western countries have now moved to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats alleged to be spies in the largest coordinated diplomatic blow to Russian intelligence networks in the west since the cold war.

Turnbull and Bishop said the attempted murder was the first offensive use of chemical weapons in Europe since the second world war and involved a highly lethal substance in a populated area, endangering countless other people.

They said the expulsion took into account advice from the UK government that the substance used on 4 March was a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia. Such an attack could not be tolerated by any sovereign nation, they said.

Bishop said: “The last time diplomats were expelled from this country was in 2012 when two Syrian diplomats were expelled because of the use by the Assad regime of chemical weapons.”

Turnbull said he expected the Russian government to expel a number of Australian diplomats from Moscow in response.

The US president, Donald Trump, this week ordered the expulsion of scores of Russian diplomats, which the US identified as intelligence agents, and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle, the most forceful action Trump has taken against Russia to date.

The British prime minister, Theresa May, has already expelled 23 Russian diplomats, among other measures, after saying the Russian state was to blame for the poison attack which left Skripal and his daughter in a critical condition.

Russia accuses UK of hiding evidence in Skripal case Read more

The Kremlin has denied any involvement.

The Russian ambassador echoed those denials in interviews on Tuesday night. “I’ve heard that but what kind of connection does it have to international law?” Grigory Logvinov said on ABC Radio National.

“How can you accuse or proclaim anyone, regardless a state or a person, a criminal without any evidence. What kind of evidence London has provided, none, because they can’t have, they don’t have and can’t have any evidence.”

Speaking on RN and to 7.30, Grigory Logvinov, the Kremlin’s ambassador to Australia, emphatically deny claims the two individuals expelled were with Russian intelligence.



“First of all I should say they are expelling two diplomats whom they call undeclared intelligence officers. But there are only professional career diplomats in my embassy here,” Logvinov told ABC radio.

“But what’s really regrettable is that, as you mentioned, Australian authorities are following the solidarity [with] Great Britain and not international law and international norms.”

Logvinov said the two “career diplomats” conducted all the usual work typically associated with an embassy. They followed international developments, reactions and wrote papers, he said.

He flagged likely retaliation from Russia. The most common response, he said, would be for Russia to expel the same number of Australian diplomats – a course Australia is already anticipating.

Asked whether the west and Russia were headed for war, he said: “Well, you see, it’s a very strong question. I am very hopeful that the humankind and the governments of the different countries are wise enough to prevent a real crisis a global crisis in international relations, international situation. That’s my best hope.”

The British high commissioner, Menna Rawlings, thanked Australia for its “unwavering support”.

“The use of a nerve agent on British soil demands concerted diplomatic action. We are grateful to have Australia and other countries with us,” Rawlings said in a statement.

“What happened in the UK could happen in any country. It was an attack not just on the UK but on international security and the rules-based order.”
